1. Most of our invoices go to Gulfstream, but we have a few others that we send them to as well. I will list them below: 

Edwards Interiors Aerospace
jessica.jackson@eiiaerospace.com

Dynamo Aviation, Inc.
sales@dynamoaviation.com

Figeac Aero North America

JET AVIATION
Jbsl.finance@jetaviation.com

LUMMUS CORPORATION

MONOGRAM SYSTEMS/SAFRAN
PAYABLESMSC@SAFRANGROUP.COM

Mountain Aviation Inc

The Gill Corporation
GILLAP@THEGILLCORP.COM

WHEELS UP
Stephanie.Garris@wheelsup.com

2. Yes, the invoices are typically due 30 days from the time they are invoiced. 

3. I think a separate column would be a great idea for the partial invoicing, but I’ll ask Camille to weigh in on what she thinks. 

I’m happy to setup a zoom call if needed, let me know. 

Thank you,

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,Phase 2 Development Updates,"Hi Sakil, 

PO# SAPO25-30883.1.2, that would mean line items 1 and 2 were shipped together. 

PO# SAPO25-38435 C means that the order was shipped out all at once and is complete. So all line items on the order would be marked as shipped, and would have the same tracking number. 

Hopefully that is clear, let me know.

I hope you are doing well. My name is Katie and I work for UP Aviation. I’m reaching out because it looks like none of the purchase orders we received yesterday went into CRM. When I try to send them again to the orders email today, still no success.

Are you able to check why this might have happened? It’s somehow fixed this morning but if there’s troubleshooting I can do in case this happens again, can you teach me what to check for?

It looks like we have a few orders in the same situation with Dexter that I mentioned yesterday. 

""Please be advised that due to updated Chinese export-controlled requirements, there has been a delay in shipping your order.
 
We are experiencing material delays related to a new export requirement mandated to our Chinese vendors from their government, with anticipated delays up to 3-4 months or longer.
 
We do not keep inventory, finished goods nor raw material on hand in most instances, so despite the timing of past Purchase orders, some going back to 2024, the impact remains.
 
Currently, we can’t provide dates and will keep you updated when more information becomes available.
 
I apologize for the delay and any inconvenience this may cause.” - Sonya Herman

I’m having the same issue as last time, no matter how many times I try the URL doesn’t work. Does this look correct to you?

I will also attach a completed version that would come from the purchase order APPO25-12240. The only thing we anticipate to have to do manual entry for is MFG P column, and possibly if we add more notes to the description that are not noted on the PO.
