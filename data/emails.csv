I’m not sure what has prompted this, but recently many of our purchase order’s “Delivery Due Date” columns have been populating incorrectly. Many of them populate backwards like this: 1/12/25 instead of 12/1/25. I have also noticed many of them are left as blank now as well. Is there a way to make it more accurate?

ksarnecky@curbellplastics.com,curbellplastics.com,[EXTERNAL] RFQ,"Good morning Kendall, 

This is what they sent back to me:

AA59502-2A0084L4 POLYCARBONATE.125 TYPE II CLS 1 WHITE QTY 16 ***HOT***
Need sheet size or unit of measurement 

SF

I guess standard, I am under the assumption that the pn or like something in the PN would tell that info, this is how ive ordered it before

KYDEX 6185 ACRYLIC/PVC QTY 30

IT JUST SAYS EACH lets do sheets…. I have no other info, so lets just do that? 

Hopefully this helps, let me know if you need me to ask anything else. 

Thank you,

Our manufacturer has announced price increases due to higher raw material and overseas shipping, duties, taxes increases. As a result, we need to increase the cost to $195.66 each on this order. 

That said, we may be able to explore options such as annual purchasing commitments to help manage costs going forward. I’d be glad to discuss this with you further.

Go to the “Ready to Invoice” table in Monday.

Add invoice quantities for all rows that do not already have a value in the Invoice Qty column.

Partial shipments are handled by Jessi, so you only need to enter quantities for full orders.

This must be completed before 3:00 PM Eastern, when automations run.

Step 2: Review Automation Errors

After 3:00 PM Eastern, automations will run.

Check the accounting@upaviation.com <> inbox for any error notifications.

If an error says an item isn’t in QuickBooks:

Log in to QuickBooks.

Add the missing item(s).

Once added, the item will be picked up automatically and invoiced the next day.

Step 3: Verify Completed Invoices

After automation completes (shortly after 3:00 PM Eastern), an email with all completed invoices will arrive in accounting@upaviation.com <>.

Check each invoice and make sure it is accurate.

Use the PO in Monday to confirm prices, quantities, and customer information are correct.

Step 4: Send Invoices

Once verified, send invoices to the accounts receivable email for the customer.

The majority of invoices go to Gulfstream at accountspayable@gulfstream.com.

We do have other customers besides Gulfstream, so always double-check before sending.

Invoices for other customers must be sent separately to their respective AR emails.

End-of-Process Summary

Fill in blank invoice qtys in Monday (skip partials — Jessi handles those).

Finish before 3:00 PM Eastern.

Fix automation errors via QuickBooks; items will auto-invoice next day.

Check completed invoices for accuracy against the PO in Monday.

Send invoices (usually to Gulfstream AR; other customers handled separately).

I wanted to let you know that the item listed on this order has unfortunately been discontinued at Dornbracht, with no stock remaining and no direct replacement available. Because of this, we will need to cancel the original order.

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Invoicing,"Hi Sakil, 

Thank you for tip, I will start doing that beforehand!

On another note, the last two days of invoicing have been a little off. It seems to only be doing around half of the invoices it should be doing. I have been making sure the products are entered into quickbooks and the invoice qty has been filled out, so I am not sure what is going on. Do you have any idea on what I might be missing?

Thank you,

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The fields typically display in the order they were originally created.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> To change the order, you would need to delete the existing fields and recreate them in the desired sequence (e.g., create “PO Number” first, then “Item IDs,” and so on).
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Important note: deleting fields may result in the loss of any data already tied to those fields, so it’s recommended to back up or export data before making changes.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Custom Fields on Reports:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When generating reports, you can usually customize the display order by selecting Customize Report and dragging/dropping columns into the preferred sequence.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> This applies only to the report view, not the forms themselves.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In short, QBO does not support drag-and-drop reordering of custom fields within forms or system-generated lists like purchase orders. The only workaround is to delete and recreate fields in the order you’d like as you previously suspected.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I've prepared a Loom recording of the automatic invoicing system to gather your feedback. You can view it here <https://www.loom.com/share/938098ed598f498c99e53eb8de9ed059?sid=2f2cdc01-b5bb-45ab-acf2-d3f09c8b01e4>.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Your feedback on these points would be greatly appreciated.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Camille – my apologies for the delay in responding; I was out of the office most of the day. Yes, I’m comfortable checking this for you or making the adjustments on your behalf.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Sakil – I reached out to QuickBooks Online (QBO) support for guidance regarding reordering the custom fields, and here’s the response I received:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Custom Fields on Forms (Purchase Orders, Invoices, etc.):
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> QBO does not currently allow direct reordering of custom fields once they’ve been created.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The fields typically display in the order they were originally created.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> To change the order, you would need to delete the existing fields and recreate them in the desired sequence (e.g., create “PO Number” first, then “Item IDs,” and so on).
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Important note: deleting fields may result in the loss of any data already tied to those fields, so it’s recommended to back up or export data before making changes.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Custom Fields on Reports:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When generating reports, you can usually customize the display order by selecting Customize Report and dragging/dropping columns into the preferred sequence.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> This applies only to the report view, not the forms themselves.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In short, QBO does not support drag-and-drop reordering of custom fields within forms or system-generated lists like purchase orders. The only workaround is to delete and recreate fields in the order you’d like as you previously suspected.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Please let me know if you’d like me to take any action in QBO on your behalf, or if it makes sense for us to schedule a quick call, as you suggested earlier, Camille.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> If they can’t or won’t, then the alternative would be to delete all of the existing custom fields and recreate them in the correct order. That said, an important question is what happens to existing documents (like invoices) that currently use those fields - QuickBooks support should be able to clarify this for you.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Important note: deleting fields may result in the loss of any data already tied to those fields, so it’s recommended to back up or export data before making changes.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Custom Fields on Reports:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When generating reports, you can usually customize the display order by selecting Customize Report and dragging/dropping columns into the preferred sequence.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> This applies only to the report view, not the forms themselves.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In short, QBO does not support drag-and-drop reordering of custom fields within forms or system-generated lists like purchase orders. The only workaround is to delete and recreate fields in the order you’d like as you previously suspected.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I've prepared a Loom recording of the automatic invoicing system to gather your feedback. You can view it here <https://www.loom.com/share/938098ed598f498c99e53eb8de9ed059?sid=2f2cdc01-b5bb-45ab-acf2-d3f09c8b01e4>.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Your feedback on these points would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for adding those blocks. Most likely they were added on there before I messaged you the first time, and I just hadn’t stumbled across them yet. The compliance forms were listed as “CCF.pdf”

I have deleted them all in CRM now, but I think I can undo it if you need to see them for reference. 

Let me know how I can assist, thank you again for all of your help!

I have noticed recently that a lot of PO’s are being created in CRM for files that we have set up to be automated now. It consists of invoices and packing slips mostly, but also some compliance forms we receive. Is there any way to fix this?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I made some adjustments to the packing slip template. Everything on there now can be permanent. Everything else needed can come from the purchase order itself. I will also attach a completed version that would come from the purchase order APPO25-12240. The only thing we anticipate to have to do manual entry for is MFG P column, and possibly if we add more notes to the description that are not noted on the PO. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I will attach the purchase order for APPO25-12240 as well, if you would like to use it as a reference. If this is confusing at all, I am happy to setup a meeting with you to explain it further. I am available anytime today until around 3pm EST, but can meet later if needed.

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Packing Slips,"Hi Sakil, 

Many of our customers have various locations that we ship to, which makes it a little tricky, but we always have the correct address listed on the purchase order as well as it is listed in it’s own column on CRM. 

Let me know if this makes sense.

>> I made some adjustments to the packing slip template. Everything on there now can be permanent. Everything else needed can come from the purchase order itself. I will also attach a completed version that would come from the purchase order APPO25-12240. The only thing we anticipate to have to do manual entry for is MFG P column, and possibly if we add more notes to the description that are not noted on the PO.

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Packing Slips,"Hi Sakil, 

I made some adjustments to the packing slip template. Everything on there now can be permanent. Everything else needed can come from the purchase order itself. I will also attach a completed version that would come from the purchase order APPO25-12240. The only thing we anticipate to have to do manual entry for is MFG P column, and possibly if we add more notes to the description that are not noted on the PO. 

I will attach the purchase order for APPO25-12240 as well, if you would like to use it as a reference. If this is confusing at all, I am happy to setup a meeting with you to explain it further. I am available anytime today until around 3pm EST, but can meet later if needed.

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Packing Slips,"Good morning Sakil, 

Would it be okay if I sent you a completed example of a packing slip on the new template with general notes on it? I think this may be the best way to explain it. I’ll begin working on it now but let me know what you think. The new columns you added is definitely a good idea, and it will aid in making this all more straightforward. 

Thank you,

kyle.kozlowski@gulfstream.com,gulfstream.com,4500522431 UP PO,"Hi Kyle,

Here are the details:

PN: 77-96187

Price: $71.41 each

Made for: iPhone 16 Pro

Drop Protection: Survives drops up to 3ft (Drop+)

Size: 5.72 in x 2.64 in x 0.03 in

Weight: 0.03 lbs

Material: Aluminosilicate glass

This updated model gives you the same durability and clarity, just tailored for the iPhone 16.

Let me know if this is something you would be interested in, as I can get it on order asap!

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> If we need to spend a few days recreating our invoice template in order to format the custom fields the way you need for automations, let me know which days. We can pause all real invoicing for that time, and then test your automations when ready. When they populating correctly, we can resume actually sending them to our customers AP.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Can we se up a meeting to go over the formats of the invoices/packing slips soon?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> To change the order, you would need to delete the existing fields and recreate them in the desired sequence (e.g., create “PO Number” first, then “Item IDs,” and so on).
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Important note: deleting fields may result in the loss of any data already tied to those fields, so it’s recommended to back up or export data before making changes.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Custom Fields on Reports:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When generating reports, you can usually customize the display order by selecting Customize Report and dragging/dropping columns into the preferred sequence.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> This applies only to the report view, not the forms themselves.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In short, QBO does not support drag-and-drop reordering of custom fields within forms or system-generated lists like purchase orders. The only workaround is to delete and recreate fields in the order you’d like as you previously suspected.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Please let me know if you’d like me to take any action in QBO on your behalf, or if it makes sense for us to schedule a quick call, as you suggested earlier, Camille.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I've prepared a Loom recording of the automatic invoicing system to gather your feedback. You can view it here <https://www.loom.com/share/938098ed598f498c99e53eb8de9ed059?sid=2f2cdc01-b5bb-45ab-acf2-d3f09c8b01e4>.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I've prepared a Loom recording of the automatic invoicing system to gather your feedback. You can view it here <https://www.loom.com/share/938098ed598f498c99e53eb8de9ed059?sid=2f2cdc01-b5bb-45ab-acf2-d3f09c8b01e4>.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Your feedback on these points would be greatly appreciated.

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Invoicing,"Hi Sakil, 

I noticed that each PO that has been invoiced by the new system seems to be creating a duplicate PO in CRM after the fact (some even have multiple duplicates). Do you want to take a look at them, or should I just delete the duplicates?

Let me know how I can help! 

Thank you,

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> QBO does not currently allow direct reordering of custom fields once they’ve been created.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The fields typically display in the order they were originally created.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> To change the order, you would need to delete the existing fields and recreate them in the desired sequence (e.g., create “PO Number” first, then “Item IDs,” and so on).
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Important note: deleting fields may result in the loss of any data already tied to those fields, so it’s recommended to back up or export data before making changes.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Custom Fields on Reports:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When generating reports, you can usually customize the display order by selecting Customize Report and dragging/dropping columns into the preferred sequence.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> This applies only to the report view, not the forms themselves.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In short, QBO does not support drag-and-drop reordering of custom fields within forms or system-generated lists like purchase orders. The only workaround is to delete and recreate fields in the order you’d like as you previously suspected.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Please let me know if you’d like me to take any action in QBO on your behalf, or if it makes sense for us to schedule a quick call, as you suggested earlier, Camille.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> PO Number (on Invoice)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Item ID (on Invoice and hidden)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The rest of the custom fields

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I've prepared a Loom recording of the automatic invoicing system to gather your feedback. You can view it here <https://www.loom.com/share/938098ed598f498c99e53eb8de9ed059?sid=2f2cdc01-b5bb-45ab-acf2-d3f09c8b01e4>.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Your feedback on these points would be greatly appreciated.

I will start going through Monday and making sure the slashes are deleted prior to invoicing. We have seen that happen recently with certain buyers, so I will just need to pay more attention to it.

When products do not exist in QBO, we have to manually add them in. I’m not really sure how to work around that, I’m guessing we will have to setup some type of alert system so we know when we need to do that for each invoice. 

The invoice quantities should be good now, I have been doing them as I see them come in, so those must have gotten shipped after I left yesterday. 

Everything else looks great! Let me know what you think we should do about the non-existing products.

I have 18 more quarts moving from the manufacturer and hope to have them ready to ship to you by Wednesday.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Camille – my apologies for the delay in responding; I was out of the office most of the day. Yes, I’m comfortable checking this for you or making the adjustments on your behalf.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Sakil – I reached out to QuickBooks Online (QBO) support for guidance regarding reordering the custom fields, and here’s the response I received:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Custom Fields on Forms (Purchase Orders, Invoices, etc.):
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> QBO does not currently allow direct reordering of custom fields once they’ve been created.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The fields typically display in the order they were originally created.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> To change the order, you would need to delete the existing fields and recreate them in the desired sequence (e.g., create “PO Number” first, then “Item IDs,” and so on).
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Important note: deleting fields may result in the loss of any data already tied to those fields, so it’s recommended to back up or export data before making changes.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Custom Fields on Reports:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When generating reports, you can usually customize the display order by selecting Customize Report and dragging/dropping columns into the preferred sequence.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> This applies only to the report view, not the forms themselves.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In short, QBO does not support drag-and-drop reordering of custom fields within forms or system-generated lists like purchase orders. The only workaround is to delete and recreate fields in the order you’d like as you previously suspected.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Please let me know if you’d like me to take any action in QBO on your behalf, or if it makes sense for us to schedule a quick call, as you suggested earlier, Camille.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I've prepared a Loom recording of the automatic invoicing system to gather your feedback. You can view it here <https://www.loom.com/share/938098ed598f498c99e53eb8de9ed059?sid=2f2cdc01-b5bb-45ab-acf2-d3f09c8b01e4>.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Invoicing,"Hi Sakil, 

The invoices from this morning should be ready to go. Although, we add more to the list throughout the whole day, usually until 3pm or so, but I will continue to monitor them to make sure they are good!

I have noticed on a few pdf’s, that instead of having a part number, they say “services” instead. One example of this is for the purchase order SAPO25-42388. 

Thank you,

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I've prepared a Loom recording of the automatic invoicing system to gather your feedback. You can view it here <https://www.loom.com/share/938098ed598f498c99e53eb8de9ed059?sid=2f2cdc01-b5bb-45ab-acf2-d3f09c8b01e4>.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Your feedback on these points would be greatly appreciated.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I’m having some trouble with the restrictive QuickBooks policy around accessing custom fields via the API. Could you please clarify the following:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> What QuickBooks plan are you currently using?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> How many custom fields do you have in total across your QuickBooks account (not just on invoices)?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Do you have custom fields enabled for all Sales forms (Sales Receipt, Invoice, Estimate, Credit Memo, and Refund Receipt) or all Purchase forms? If not, could you ensure they’re enabled?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> How difficult would it be for you to delete your existing custom fields and recreate them in this order:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> PO Number (on Invoice)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Item ID (on Invoice and hidden)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The rest of the custom fields
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The reason is that QuickBooks only provides API access to the first three string-based custom fields. While everything else in the auto-invoicing flow is working, I can’t automatically populate the PO Number because it likely isn’t within those first three.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I’d be happy to jump on a quick call today between 12:30 and 2:00 your time. I realize this is short notice, so if that doesn’t work, I completely understand and we can reschedule for Tuesday.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I've prepared a Loom recording of the automatic invoicing system to gather your feedback. You can view it here <https://www.loom.com/share/938098ed598f498c99e53eb8de9ed059?sid=2f2cdc01-b5bb-45ab-acf2-d3f09c8b01e4>.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Here's a quick overview:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> In addition to changing a line item's status to ""ready to invoice"", you'll now need to specify whether you want it as a single invoice or part of a group invoice.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> For partial invoicing, I've added a new column where you can enter the quantity you wish to invoice. While I can implement logic to ignore this for non-partial invoices, I highly recommend using this column for all invoices to prevent errors.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> The automation will run for a defined number of times a day, sweep all of the line items ready to be invoiced, and generate invoices based on the grouping status (single/group) and the invoice quantity. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Once we've finalized this, I'll move on to packing slips. I have a few questions regarding them:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> When would you prefer the packing slips to be auto-generated?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Does one invoice typically correspond to one shipment, and therefore one packing slip?

>> The invoicing process looks great! I do have a few questions though.
>> 
>> So we have recently started adding the invoice files in another column after we create them. Is there a way to somehow incorporate that into the process? 
>> 
>> Also, after the process has been completed, will the 'ready to invoice' tab change to ‘sent'? Or is that something we will need to go back and do?

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Invoicing,"Good morning Sakil, 

The invoicing process looks great! I do have a few questions though.

So we have recently started adding the invoice files in another column after we create them. Is there a way to somehow incorporate that into the process? 

Also, after the process has been completed, will the 'ready to invoice' tab change to ‘sent'? Or is that something we will need to go back and do? 

Thank you,

We received a partial shipment for this order and need to wait so we can ship complete. We will also need to ship these standard overnight with our GPS tracker, as we have a new policy requiring that all electronics be shipped via air. In addition, any orders with a total cost over $3,000 must also ship by air.

We expect to have the order shipped out on Wednesday, 8/27. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

Thank you,

Did you have the chance to amend the cost on this part below? Camille mentioned we should have the amended PO for it, but I am not finding it on my end. If you wouldn't mind resending it, that would be very helpful.

1. Most of our invoices go to Gulfstream, but we have a few others that we send them to as well. I will list them below: 

Edwards Interiors Aerospace
jessica.jackson@eiiaerospace.com

Dynamo Aviation, Inc.
sales@dynamoaviation.com

Figeac Aero North America

JET AVIATION
Jbsl.finance@jetaviation.com

LUMMUS CORPORATION

MONOGRAM SYSTEMS/SAFRAN

Mountain Aviation Inc

The Gill Corporation
GILLAP@THEGILLCORP.COM

WHEELS UP
Stephanie.Garris@wheelsup.com

2. Yes, the invoices are typically due 30 days from the time they are invoiced. 

3. I think a separate column would be a great idea for the partial invoicing, but I’ll ask Camille to weigh in on what she thinks. 

I’m happy to setup a zoom call if needed, let me know.

I sent it again and was successful for most of the po’s! 

The tracking number for APPO25-11909.4 did not populate, but there was a typo in the shipment report.

DAPO25-06680.1 did not populate either so it may just be when it’s specific line items only. 

All the other ones look good though!

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,Phase 2 Development Updates,"Hi Sakil, 

For your first question, there are 3 lines for SAPO25-25703.3 because they were shipped in separate boxes. 

The naming pattern itself stems from the purchase order line items. So for instance, SAPO25-25703.3 would mean that the third subitem on the PO SAPO25-25703 was shipped out. (This is usually correct in CRM, but I typically verify by clicking the PO file to see if they are listed in the correct order). SAPO25-25703.3 is PN: MIL-PRF-46010. 

Piece tracking number is the correct column for outbound tracking. 

To answer your last question, even though SAPO25-25703.3 was sent out in three different boxes, the 3 tracking numbers still go onto the same line on CRM. We typically would format it like this in the outbound tracking number category: ""883394152765, 883394152776, 883394152787”  

Let me know if you have more questions. Thank you!

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,Phase 2 Development Updates,"HelloSakil, 

I like this look but we need to add more cells and to add the log and our C of C at the bottom, and make all of the green blue.  

So each location that we ship to should have it own editable packing slip and with the shipping address listed at the top. 
Ideally we want to simply click the sub line item, have it populate that exact info into this doc, then be able to edit and add from there. 
At the top we need a cell for Part Number, Description, Condition, QTY ordered QTY shipped, and then there can be cells below all of that info that we can add a serial number, lot/batch, date of manufacture/ expiration.

Also, they wanted to know how this part is being used? Depending on that, I might need to get referred elsewhere.

I hope your summer is going well : ) 

Our order is almost 8 weeks late and we can’t get any type of recovery shipment date from Heather or anyone else in customer service. Do you know why this is delayed and if the material is with your company yet? Is there just a back log of orders to work through? 

I need to update Gulfstream and they are asking for updates several times per day. Any chance you have insight here?

I hope you are doing well. My name is Katie and I work for UP Aviation. I’m reaching out because it looks like none of the purchase orders we received yesterday went into CRM. When I try to send them again to the orders email today, still no success. 

Are you able to check why this might be happening?

It looks like we have a few orders in the same situation with Dexter that I mentioned yesterday. 

""Please be advised that due to updated Chinese export-controlled requirements, there has been a delay in shipping your order.
 
We are experiencing material delays related to a new export requirement mandated to our Chinese vendors from their government, with anticipated delays up to 3-4 months or longer.
 
We do not keep inventory, finished goods nor raw material on hand in most instances, so despite the timing of past Purchase orders, some going back to 2024, the impact remains.
 
Currently, we can’t provide dates and will keep you updated when more information becomes available.
 
I apologize for the delay and any inconvenience this may cause.” - Sonya Herman
