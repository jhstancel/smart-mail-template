I hope you are doing well. My name is Katie and I work for UP Aviation. I’m reaching out because it looks like none of the purchase orders we received yesterday went into CRM. When I try to send them again to the orders email today, still no success. 

Are you able to check why this might be happening? 

Thank you,
