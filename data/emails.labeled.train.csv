4500402523
 “
8/5 This order has been delayed and pushed back till 2026 by supplier. Need to Cancel or get the PO dates pushed back.

ksarnecky@curbellplastics.com,curbellplastics.com,[EXTERNAL] RFQ,"Good morning Kendall, 

This is what they sent back to me:

AA59502-2A0084L4 POLYCARBONATE.125 TYPE II CLS 1 WHITE QTY 16 ***HOT***
Need sheet size or unit of measurement 

SF

I guess standard, I am under the assumption that the pn or like something in the PN would tell that info, this is how ive ordered it before

KYDEX 6185 ACRYLIC/PVC QTY 30

IT JUST SAYS EACH lets do sheets…. I have no other info, so lets just do that? 

Hopefully this helps, let me know if you need me to ask anything else. 

Thank you,

I have noticed recently that a lot of PO’s are being created in CRM for files that we have set up to be automated now. It consists of invoices and packing slips mostly, but also some compliance forms we receive. Is there any way to fix this?

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Packing Slips,"Hi Sakil, 

Many of our customers have various locations that we ship to, which makes it a little tricky, but we always have the correct address listed on the purchase order as well as it is listed in it’s own column on CRM. 

Let me know if this makes sense. 

Thank you,

I will also attach a completed version that would come from the purchase order APPO25-12240. The only thing we anticipate to have to do manual entry for is MFG P column, and possibly if we add more notes to the description that are not noted on the PO.

I’m having the same issue as last time, no matter how many times I try the URL doesn’t work. Does this look correct to you? 

function doPost(e) {
 try {
   // Parse JSON body
   const params = e.postData.contents ? JSON.parse(e.postData.contents) : {};

   // Defaults if not provided
   const customFilename = params.filename || ""packing-slip.pdf"";

   // Spreadsheet & folder
   const spreadsheetId = params.spreadsheetId;
   const sheetName = ""Packing Slip"";
   const folderId = ""1asOmvSaOONyNm-wXZY5WzhlYz2bmU3TX"";
   const folder = DriveApp.getFolderById(folderId);

   // Export the sheet
   const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName(sheetName);
   const url = ""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/"" + spreadsheetId +

I made some adjustments to the packing slip template. Everything on there now can be permanent. Everything else needed can come from the purchase order itself. I will also attach a completed version that would come from the purchase order APPO25-12240. The only thing we anticipate to have to do manual entry for is MFG P column, and possibly if we add more notes to the description that are not noted on the PO. 

I will attach the purchase order for APPO25-12240 as well, if you would like to use it as a reference. If this is confusing at all, I am happy to setup a meeting with you to explain it further. I am available anytime today until around 3pm EST, but can meet later if needed.

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Packing Slips,"Good morning Sakil, 

Would it be okay if I sent you a completed example of a packing slip on the new template with general notes on it? I think this may be the best way to explain it. I’ll begin working on it now but let me know what you think. The new columns you added is definitely a good idea, and it will aid in making this all more straightforward. 

Thank you,

We are making the last final touches to the packing slip now, I anticipate it being done by the end of today! 

Also, is there any way you can run the invoice automation earlier than 3pm today? We are done adding shipments for the day, so we can go ahead and invoice.

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Invocing Issues,"Good morning Sakil, 

When products do not exist in QBO, we have to manually add them in. I’m not really sure how to work around that, I’m guessing we will have to setup some type of alert system so we know when we need to do that for each invoice. 

The invoice quantities should be good now, I have been doing them as I see them come in, so those must have gotten shipped after I left yesterday. 

Everything else looks great! Let me know what you think we should do about the non-existing products.

We received tracking on ours, but the movement on the parcel stopped before it was delivered to us. I checked with FedEx, and they said it was scrapped due to damage.

I have 18 more quarts moving from the manufacturer and hope to have them ready to ship to you by Wednesday.

I sincerely apologize that this wasn’t caught sooner and will work to expedite the recovery order as much as I possibly can.

sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,2nd Phase Integrations: Invoicing,"Good morning Sakil, 

The invoicing process looks great! I do have a few questions though.

So we have recently started adding the invoice files in another column after we create them. Is there a way to somehow incorporate that into the process? 

Also, after the process has been completed, will the 'ready to invoice' tab change to ‘sent'? Or is that something we will need to go back and do? 

Thank you,

We received a partial shipment for this order and need to wait so we can ship complete. We will also need to ship these standard overnight with our GPS tracker, as we have a new policy requiring that all electronics be shipped via air. In addition, any orders with a total cost over $3,000 must also ship by air.

We expect to have the order shipped out on Wednesday, 8/27. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

Thank you,

chris.fuller@gulfstream.com,gulfstream.com,DAPO25-06822 PURCHASE ORDER ATTACHED TO CONFIRM,"Hi Chris,

The P/N MN873LL/A does not include ethernet. The correct model for that would be MN893LL/A, which also comes with 128GB of storage instead of 64GB. The quote for that model is below:

Cost: $200 each
Lead time: 7–10 days

I sent it again and was successful for most of the po’s! 

The tracking number for APPO25-11909.4 did not populate, but there was a typo in the shipment report.

DAPO25-06680.1 did not populate either so it may just be when it’s specific line items only.

_____________________________________________",shipment_update
sakil@crmcrew.com,crmcrew.com,Phase 2 Development Updates,"Hi Sakil, 

For your first question, there are 3 lines for SAPO25-25703.3 because they were shipped in separate boxes. 

The naming pattern itself stems from the purchase order line items. So for instance, SAPO25-25703.3 would mean that the third subitem on the PO SAPO25-25703 was shipped out. (This is usually correct in CRM, but I typically verify by clicking the PO file to see if they are listed in the correct order). SAPO25-25703.3 is PN: MIL-PRF-46010. 

Piece tracking number is the correct column for outbound tracking. 

To answer your last question, even though SAPO25-25703.3 was sent out in three different boxes, the 3 tracking numbers still go onto the same line on CRM. We typically would format it like this in the outbound tracking number category: ""883394152765, 883394152776, 883394152787”  

Let me know if you have more questions. Thank you!

I like this look but we need to add more cells and to add the log and our C of C at the bottom, and make all of the green blue.  

So each location that we ship to should have it own editable packing slip and with the shipping address listed at the top. 
Ideally we want to simply click the sub line item, have it populate that exact info into this doc, then be able to edit and add from there. 
At the top we need a cell for Part Number, Description, Condition, QTY ordered QTY shipped, and then there can be cells below all of that info that we can add a serial number, lot/batch, date of manufacture/ expiration.

jacob.carroll@gulfstream.com,gulfstream.com,RFQ for PT15 SINGLE DUROMETER,"Hi Jacob, 

I just heard back from a seller, they said they offer  3/16"" x 2 x 1445"" strips of Vulkollan 80A.

Also, they wanted to know how this part is being used? Depending on that, I might need to get referred elsewhere. 

Thank you,

I hope you are doing well. My name is Katie and I work for UP Aviation. I’m reaching out because it looks like none of the purchase orders we received yesterday went into CRM. When I try to send them again to the orders email today, still no success. 

Are you able to check why this might be happening?

It looks like we have a few orders in the same situation with Dexter that I mentioned yesterday. 

""Please be advised that due to updated Chinese export-controlled requirements, there has been a delay in shipping your order.
 
We are experiencing material delays related to a new export requirement mandated to our Chinese vendors from their government, with anticipated delays up to 3-4 months or longer.
 
We do not keep inventory, finished goods nor raw material on hand in most instances, so despite the timing of past Purchase orders, some going back to 2024, the impact remains.
 
Currently, we can’t provide dates and will keep you updated when more information becomes available.
 
I apologize for the delay and any inconvenience this may cause.” - Sonya Herman

My name is Katie and I work for UP Aviation. I looked into this for you, and we received the order today. Jessi will be sending the tracking number soon. Would you like overnight shipping?

Can we push the dock date on line 2 to 6/1? The tape is in transit to us and we will get that to you asap. 

Have a great day, 
Katie Hilton",shipment_update
