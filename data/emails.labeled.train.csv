I just heard back from a seller, they said they offer  3/16"" x 2 x 1445"" strips of Vulkollan 80A.

Also, they wanted to know how this part is being used? Depending on that, I might need to get referred elsewhere.

It looks like we have a few orders in the same situation with Dexter that I mentioned yesterday. 

""Please be advised that due to updated Chinese export-controlled requirements, there has been a delay in shipping your order.
 
We are experiencing material delays related to a new export requirement mandated to our Chinese vendors from their government, with anticipated delays up to 3-4 months or longer.
 
We do not keep inventory, finished goods nor raw material on hand in most instances, so despite the timing of past Purchase orders, some going back to 2024, the impact remains.
 
Currently, we can‚Äôt provide dates and will keep you updated when more information becomes available.
 
I apologize for the delay and any inconvenience this may cause.‚Äù - Sonya Herman

Dynamo Aviation, Inc.

WHEELS UP

2. Yes, the invoices are typically due 30 days from the time they are invoiced. 

3. I think a separate column would be a great idea for the partial invoicing, but I‚Äôll ask Camille to weigh in on what she thinks. 

I‚Äôm happy to setup a zoom call if needed, let me know.
