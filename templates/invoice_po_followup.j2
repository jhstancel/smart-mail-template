Subject: Follow-Up on Invoice {{ invoiceNumber }} / PO {{ poNumber }} — Due {{ dueDate }}

Hi {{ recipientName }},

Just a quick follow-up regarding Invoice {{ invoiceNumber }} for PO {{ poNumber }}, due on {{ dueDate }}.

I've attached the invoice and packing slip for reference.

Can you confirm:
• Has the PO been received in full?
• Were any discrepancies noted?
• Is payment still on track by {{ dueDate }}?

Please let me know if anything is needed to complete processing.
Thank you,
