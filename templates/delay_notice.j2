Subject: Schedule Update – PO {{ poNumber }} / {{ partNumber }}

Hi {{ customerName }},

I want to share a quick schedule update for PO {{ poNumber }} ({{ partNumber }}). 
Due to {{ reason }}, the ship date has shifted:

• Previous ship date: {{ previousShip | shortdate }}
• New ship date: {{ newShip | shortdate }}

I’m sorry for the inconvenience this may cause. If it helps, we can discuss options such as partial shipments, 
expedited freight, or alternatives. Please let me know your priorities and I’ll align the plan accordingly.

Thank you for your understanding,
